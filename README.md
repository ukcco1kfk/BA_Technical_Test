# BA_Technical_Test

Introduction
Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test.

The test is comprised of three parts:

Review and suggest improvements for a feature file
Create 2 new BDD scenarios using the Gherkin syntax and add them to the feature file
Automate the three scenarios
Once you have completed all three activites, please create a zip file containing your answers and email it to the recruiter. This will then be passed on to the hiring manager at Clear Channel.

The zip file should contain a folder which includes the search.feature file and all associated automation code from the technical test

Instructions
TASK 1: Review and improve a feature file
As a Senior QA Engineer, your role will include peer reviewing BDD scenarios (written using the Gherkin syntax) as well as step definitions written by other members of the QA team.

In this repo there is a file named search.feature Imagine this has been created by another QA Engineer on your team. Please take a copy of the feature file. Once you have a copy, please review the contents of the feature file and update or change anything which you think can be improved upon.

TASK 2: Add scenarios to the feature file
Create two additional scenarios which will test the search functionality on the website. Choose the two which you think will add the most value.

Add these to search.feature

What we are looking for:
After you have submitted your technical test, we will be assessing the following:

Identifying opportunities for improvement - what changes have you made to the sample Gherkin scenario? Have these changes improved it?
Code quality - do the tests compile and run? Does each scenario test what is is meant to?
Readibility - is the feature file and automation code written in a way that is easy for others to understand? Does the Readme provide adequate intructions?
